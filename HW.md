### Lessons Learned & Open Questions

#### Lessons
1. Learning how to translate notebook code into scripts.
2. Learning/reminder that HF spaces can be used in dev mode and connected to VSCode.
3. Learning how to setup LCEL RAG Chain.
    - Understand how to deploy open-source LLMs & embedding models to scalable endpoints for production-grade LLM & RAG applications
    - Build a RAG application with LCEL
    - Build a front-end UI for RAG applications with Chainlit

#### Questions
1. What are the challenges using LangChain in production - see lots of folks complaining about it on LinkedIn and Twitter. 
2. What complex RAG looks like.
3. Have a basic understanding of the metrics used to monitor performance but still a novice with regards to LLM evals.
